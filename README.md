Handible is an intuitive JavaScript library for hand gesture detection and interaction in 3D scenes. It lets you build magical experiences without expensive gear but just your normal webcam. It includes features like pinching objects, palm-facing UI panels, or grid-snapping on virtual tables. It is powered by MediaPipe for real-time hand tracking and Three.js for visuals. Perfect for games, tools, or creative apps—turn your webcam into a wand! 🪄

Inspired by demos like interactive whiteboards and chessboards on tables, Handible makes it easy to add gesture controls without the hassle.

## 🚀 Features

- **Palm Facing Check**: Detect if the palm is facing the camera to trigger UI or actions. 👋
